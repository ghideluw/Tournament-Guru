# Tournament Guru

## Description

This project was aimed to build a single page application under the MERN model. The application is a video game tournament manager that aims to allows a community of
gamers to utilise the app in the aim to establish, organize, manage, and implement tournaments for players. The application allows users to register teams, assign a 
tournament manager, create events, and allow users to sign up/create an account to be able to participate in any event. This application is geared towards creating a 
community for players to compete and demonstrate their skills amongst peers and takes the grunt work out of the organization and administrative tasks that come with 
setting up events and tournaments. The application is a simple and user friendly UI that is comprehensive, while still providing all the functionality to execute and 
plan successful tournaments. 

Tha application uses REACT in the frontend, and GRAPHQL with a Node.js and Express.js server in the backend to connect to the database. To operate the database, MongoDB
and Mongoose will be utilised. Authentication of secure user information will implement BCRYPT and JWT. The application was deployed using Heroku for access by users alike.
